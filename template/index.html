                    is an online platform
                    designed for college students and
                    teachers to share and manage notes. The website allows teachers to upload and share their notes
                    with
                    their students, making it easier for them to access and study the material.
                    This website is only accessible those teachers and students, who are registered in the system.
                    Students can then log into the website and access the notes for their specific classes. They can
                    download the notes, print them, or even annotate them directly on the website. The notes are
                    organized
                    by class, making it easy for students to find the material they need.
